The complete visual interface for building, deploying, and managing intelligent AI agents. SmythOS UI provides an intuitive drag-and-drop workspace where you can create sophisticated agent workflows without writing code, while still offering the flexibility of custom integrations when needed.

[üöÄ Getting Started](#quick-start) | [üìñ Documentation](#documentation) | [üê≥ Docker Setup](#docker-quick-start) | [ü§ù Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Why SmythOS UI exists

1. **Visual Agent Building**: Creating AI agents should be as intuitive as drawing a flowchart.
2. **No-Code to Pro-Code**: Start with visual building, extend with custom code when needed.
3. **Open Architecture**: Build once, deploy anywhere with complete control over your infrastructure.

## Design Principles

SmythOS UI provides a **complete visual development environment** for AI agents. Just as modern IDEs make software development accessible, SmythOS UI makes AI agent development intuitive and powerful.

### Visual-First Development

SmythOS UI offers a **drag-and-drop interface** for building complex agent workflows. Whether you're connecting LLMs, integrating APIs, processing data, or orchestrating multi-step workflows, everything is visual and intuitive.

This approach makes AI agent development **accessible to everyone** - from business analysts who understand the processes to developers who need to scale them to production.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Intuitive Visual Builder**: Drag-and-drop components to build complex agent workflows
- **Real-Time Testing**: Test your agents instantly as you build them
- **Production Deployment**: One-click deployment from development to production
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add custom components and integrations
- **Collaborative Development**: Share and collaborate on agent projects with your team

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Docker Quick Start

Get up and running instantly with Docker Compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmythOS/smythos-studio.git
cd smythos-studio
cp .env.compose.example .env
docker compose up -d

```

**Access your application:** http://localhost:5050

üê≥ **Full Docker Setup**: See our [Docker Compose Guide](DOCKER_COMPOSE.md) for production-ready multi-container deployment with automatic SSL, database, and caching.

### Method 2: Local Development Setup

Perfect for development, customization, and contributing to the project.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SmythOS/smythos-studio.git
cd smythos-studio

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

**Next Steps:**
1. Configure your MySQL database in `.env`
2. Set up required subdomains for embodiments
3. Start building your first agent!

üìñ **Detailed Setup**: See our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for complete development setup instructions.



Get up and running instantly with a single Docker command.

```bash
# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env
# REQUIRED: Edit .env with your database credentials

# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t smythos-studio .
docker run -d \
  --name smythos-studio \
  -p 5050:5050 \
  -p 5053:5053 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v smythos_data:/home/node/smythos-data \
  smythos-studio:latest
```
